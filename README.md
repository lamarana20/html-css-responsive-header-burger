This project is a basic practice exercise to improve my HTML and CSS skills.  
It includes a modern responsive header with:

- 🔹 Sticky navbar  
- 🔹 Accessible navigation (`:focus-visible`)  
- 🔹 Burger menu without JavaScript (CSS only)  
- 🔹 Responsive layout using media queries  
- 🔹 Clean structure and modern UI styling  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- CSS3 (Flexbox, Position, Media Queries)

## 📱 Responsive Features

- Smooth hover and focus styles for accessibility

## 📌 Objective
Strengthen my front-end fundamentals and practice building functional UI components with only HTML and CSS.
